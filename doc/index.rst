Die Brummbeere
==============

ownCloud Music Player
---------------------

.. image:: _static/img/brummbeere_raspi.jpg

Die Brummbeere is an ownCloud audio player based on the Qt framework. The
application was written for embedded systems in mind, so it features a very
simplistic user interface suitable for low resolutions and optimized for lo
energy consumption. It still runs on Linux and Mac. Windows is currently not
supported due to a lack of audio streaming support from password protected
locations on Windows. That might be fixed in future Qt versions.
