==============

ownCloud Music Player
---------------------

Die Brummbeere is an ownCloud audio player based on the Qt framework. The
application was written for embedded systems in mind, so it features a very
simplistic user interface suitable for low resolutions and optimized for lo
energy consumption. It still runs on Linux and Mac.
