# TwoMusic

An ownCloud audio player written for the Qt framework. The application was
written for embedded systems in mind, so it features a very simplistic user
interface suitable for low resolutions and optimized for low energy consumption.
It still runs on Linux and Mac. Windows is currently not supported due to a
lack of audio streaming support from password protected locations on Windows.
That might be fixed in future Qt versions.
